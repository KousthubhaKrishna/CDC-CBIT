# CDC-CBIT

In the contemporary world, Digitalization has become essential for any institution to stay competitive, achieve high productivity, and accomplish their goals. The project “CDC - CBIT” is the digital solution for CBIT that helps in managing all career-development activities (especially placements).

The project aims to study and provide an automated solution for all the tedious and manual tasks being carried out at CDC. Most of these tasks/works are redundant, resulting in wastage of time and human efforts. Important ones include data-collection, verification, and validation, etc. Also, there is a great need for a common communication platform so that students, faculty, management, and all other concerned persons can be up to date with all the placement related information.

This can be achieved by creating a centralized data-store and further building an end-to-end web application and a cross-platform mobile application. The important features of the application include role-based access control, multiple data retrieving and reporting capabilities, enhanced user experience, and many more.

Such an ideal solution thus reduces the chances of human errors thereby preventing conflicts in schedules and loss of opportunities. And helps the institution to operate with high efficiency and paves the way to implement advanced techniques like Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
